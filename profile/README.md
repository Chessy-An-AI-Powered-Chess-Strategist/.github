# Chessy
___
Chess, with its complex strategy and vast number of possible moves, presents a significant challenge for artificial intelligence research. Our project goal is to develop Chessy, an AI that can play chess at a high level of competence, by learning from historical game data. This project aims to explore the intersection of machine learning and game theory, demonstrating how an AI can adapt to and anticipate an opponent’s moves.

The foundation of Chessy’s strategy is a decision tree algorithm, which will analyze over 3.5 million past chess games. This extensive dataset will allow Chessy to recognize patterns and strategies that have led to victory in a wide range of situations. By studying the outcomes of these games, Chessy aims to mimic the decision-making process of experienced chess players, from opening moves to endgame tactics.

The motivation behind Chessy is not only to create a challenging opponent for chess enthusiasts but also to advance the field of AI in understanding complex decision-making processes. This project stands at the confluence of data analysis, machine learning, and game strategy, showcasing the potential of AI to master tasks that require deep intellectual engagement and adaptability.
